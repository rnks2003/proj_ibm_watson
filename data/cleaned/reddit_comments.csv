He treated me horribly, but I also had codependency issues and a lot of shame and guilt, and tried to make it work.\n\nI was not at my best when I was drinking. But it wasn\'t about that. It was because I wasn\'t drinking, anymore.\n\nHe would yell at me when I asked him not to drink beer in my condo, sneer at me with derision at what felt like every comment I made, and insult me and my character constantly. He came to me saying he found websites that said alcoholism wasn\'t a disease, it just showed I was weak. \n\nI tearfully asked him why I would ever make a choice that would cause pain in my own and his lives, and he just told me I was pathetic and I\'d never stay sober.\n\nWhen I got sober, I asked him what would help him see that I was serious this time, and he said 30 days sober. So when I got my 30 day chip, he took it, said ""what the fuck is this I don\'t want this,"" and threw it in the trash. I finally gained a backbone in that moment and we broke up.\n\nLooking back, he wanted me to keep drinking because alcohol was a huge focus in his life. He was also trying to get me to break up with him because he was too chicken shit. But the way he treated me in that month, I had zero love for him by the end of it; he was emotionally abusive before but never like that.\n\nAlso, I realized he had the personality of a wet Kleenex and could do much better. He only had a personality when he drank.\n\nGood news is I\'m so much stronger and better now than I ever was when I was with him.', 'He was the hardest partying dude I knew. We\'d known each other for years, and been flirty for most of that. We\'d make out when drunk, then go and pursue other people. I heard that he wanted more, but life got in the way, for years, mostly in the form of a newfound partner who entered my life.\n\nAt the time I was relieved, as I didn\'t want anything more from him. Frankly, I never really took him seriously.\n\nThen I got dumped, out of nowhere.\n\nHe popped up and made sure I was OK. He listened to me rant and paint the air blue cussing out my now-ex, whenever I needed it, for weeks. He was so caring, and concerned, and _unhorny_, it shocked me.\n\nA few months passed, and I got back on my feet. He approached me at a party and asked me out. No flirting, he just properly asked me out. I still didn\'t want more from him, but I said yes because saying no would have crushed him. I figured the date would be a crash-landing, a realisation that the woman he\'d been chasing, on and off, for five years, was just a basic bitch.\n\nWe went on that date, and for the first time ever we actually talked, properly, without alcohol impeding us and without trying to ""keep it light"" or ""be fun"" (I mean, beyond wanting to be fun in the context of our dinner date).\n\nThat\'s when I found out about his past. I will spare you the gory details, but he survived a car crash that killed half his family when he was a child. It left him with mild brain damage that made him a bit ""dotty"", and made his dyslexia worse. He was told, every day of his childhood, that he was too stupid to amount to anything.\n\nA fact he bookended by mentioning that for twenty years he worked dead-end jobs, ate like a pauper, drank nothing but bottom-shelf swill, and dressed almost in rags, all so he could save up to go to college; his first semester was due to start in a few weeks, but he was too embarrassed to talk about going to college at nearly 40.\n\nBy the end of our date I saw him in a different light. I saw a man who had turned the dismissiveness that an ignorant world, including me, had heaped on him, into something beautiful. He refused to become bitter, or hateful. I don\'t understand how or why, it\'s a miracle all on its own. I saw a man who wasn\'t ""stupid"", but a man who had been let down by the education system and hadn\'t been able to enjoy the same benefits from academia that billions of people take for granted. I saw a man who, under the exterior of cheap booze and hand-rolled cigarettes, just wanted to prove himself to the world, despite staggering odds.\n\nBy the end of our second date, which I acquiesced to the instant he proposed it, I knew I had found a Good Person. Again he surprised me, this time with his creative mind; we invented identities for and roleplayed as aliens from the planet Gliese 6, just a goof that we took as far as we could, and he kept up with me at every beat, something I wouldn\'t have thought him capable of in a million years, just a month prior. I already knew he was a nerd of similar calibre to me, but we spent that night swapping in-depth likes and dislikes, and, to my delight, he ticked every box for me, and vice versa (except Gordon Ramsey, sorry, not my thing!).\n\nBy the end of the third date I realised he was the calmest, most considerate, most thoughtful person I\'d ever met. I\'d spent most of the preceding two decades looking after people, from partners to terminally ill family members, and for the first time in as long as I could remember, he made me feel safe, and looked after.\n\nBy the end of the fourth date I had fallen in love with him, like a moon-eyed teenager. If someone could bottle the feeling I had when I fell asleep on his chest, his fingers in my hair, they\'d make trillions. He made me feel invincible.\n\nWe said those three little words on our sixth date. I said it first, I couldn\'t help myself. Two months earlier he was just the slightly weird guy who was at every party, to me.\n\nAt time of writing we\'ve been together for a year, he\'s on track for a GPA of 3.7, and I have never known love like it. I literally have no complaints. I am proud of him, I am proud to be with him, and I am _excited_ to take on the future with him by my side. For his part, he loves me just as much as I love him, and seems to be in genuine awe of me as a person; I have no idea why, but I\'m not questioning it!\n\nEDIT: made some tweaks to the text. No, our relationship is not centred around alcohol, I just knew him mostly from parties and nights out.

I’d defend him when various people in his life completely dropped him bc he’s selfish and self centered. He’s gone through over a dozen bands (very talented), personal relationships, lost close friends, etc. \n\nMy aging parents wanted to sell their lake property (permanent address) because it was too much for them. They offered it to all of us kids. Everyone declined. I even asked my brother if he wanted to split it to keep it in the family. In the end me and my fiancé were able to buy it because our jobs went fully remote and they put fiber optic in the area. Mind you: everyone is still welcome to put their campers here, etc. nothing was supposed to change. \n\nThis all happened over the course of a few years: there were no surprises. But when we went through with the sale he flat out told me he was pissed at mom and dad and to stay out of it: he said in so many words he wanted to piss them off and hurt them.\n\nI thought he was just blowing off steam and didn’t mean it. But he did. He pulled his camper out, sold it. Started demanding to be refunded on stupid shit he “invested” in the place like a dog kennel panel or the electric line he put in to feed his camper. \n\nSince my family is super nosy I had asked my parents to keep the sale price between us. Well that didn’t sit well with my brother who insisted they get multiple comparative market analysis. But he kept carrying on about being left out of the sale price. Tried saying it was a family keeping secrets issue. \n\nI stayed out of it until dad begged me to tell him to “get your brother off my back”. So in disgust I sent him the price. But of course that wasn’t good enough. Meanwhile we’re hearing things he’s saying. Things like “inheritance”, but he paints it to certain people in ways like it’s a family thing, we’re hiding shit from him. In reality he just wanted to inherit the place for nothing and was pissed mom and dad were selling. He wanted to make sure we didn’t get any sort of deal and in the end is still pissed bc mom and dad could’ve gotten more for the place due to the market being so good. (Then turns around and bitches about them “pissing it all away”)\n\nIf we hadn’t bought the place it would still have been sold. I have no doubt he went as far as saying we were trying to screw mom and dad over or pressuring them into selling. \n\nMom’s surprise 80th birthday party rolled around. Leading up he had no less than three excuses for not coming. My sister even met with him the week prior saying “you better change your plans”. He didn’t show. She lost her shit at him. And then he called my mom and said the reason he didn’t come was because he didnt want  to ruin her day by picking a fight with me (trying to paint it as a positive). During this time he was also poisoning his daughter (my niece who is extremely close) against us. I’m just now repairing that relationship two years later. \n\nSo I finally lost my shit and called him up screaming at him over his voicemail after he hung up to me saying “I aint your FUCKING EXCUSE”. I didn’t hold back. I regret NONE of it. Everything I said he had coming and he’s lucky I left it at words. \n\nHe’s apologized to everyone in the fucking family except me. My sister who had disowned him wound up forgiving him. So they’re all cool. Which is nice for all of them. \n\nTwo fucking years. At this point the length of time is more of an insult. What’s worse is everyone laying guilt trips on ME for skipping family holidays bc I refuse to be in the same fucking room with him. I’m the youngest in the family and this was just the last major straw for my much older siblings treating me like the family whipping post. In the past I have always been pressured to make the peace bc my siblings never will. Not this time. \n\nSorry we bought mom and dad’s property and we didn’t agree that you were entitled to be involved in the sale. Fuck you dude. I guess I always knew what sort of person he was but never thought he’d turn that side on me. \n\nTLDR: my brother (55) threw a summer long tantrum over “losing his inheritance”, poisoned his daughter against the family, skipped my mothers 80th bday and blamed it on me (43) who hadn’t said a word about his behavior, and has apologized to everyone except me who he hasn’t spoken to in over two years.

After a night of pizza and alcohol, she made a move on me. Myself being a bit lonely at the time and recognizing that she was pretty, I went with it. Why not?

So, she went around telling people that I abused my then-girlfriend. She convinced people that I was a PDF because I worked with children at a school for 8 years (I want to go into education and figured some experience would suite me well when I went to college). She told people any number of horrible things about me, as well as my family (who accepted her as one of the family up until this point), and they believed her because she had this aura about her that she was trustworthy. I don't know the full scope of what they were told, but apparently it was enough so that a year and a half of being close with these people didn't matter in the slightest in their choice to throw me away.\n\nAnd then I realized that this is who she is. She would often tell me everyone else's secrets whenever we would hang out, and use it as leverage to gain social standing with everyone. She manipulated everyone around her so she could always be the center of attention. Nothing was secret with her, and everyone was a piece in a game that she was playing to climb the social ladder and lord over us.

He sent me a picture of four women. I guessed which one it was and he told me no, that was actually his sister. He sent me her contact info and we ended up getting along really well.\n\nFor a bunch of reasons that made sense at the time, she and I never met. One of the larger reasons was that although we were friendly, I had no desire to meet her brother because, again, I was still interested in his girlfriend. Eventually, they broke up. I stayed in touch with the sister for a bit, but at some point we stopped talking too. I don\'t remember the details now.\n\nYears later, after moving halfway across the country, I was consolidating files from a few old computers and I came across pictures of the sister. For some reason, I decided to do a reverse image search (google images, tineye, etc.) on them.\n\nThe ""sister"" was a deceased girl from Michigan with an entirely different name. \n\nThere were definitely signs things were off, which is why I made the search. Despite living in the same city, we never met. There were plans, but something always got in the way. We never even talked on the phone. There is one picture of ""her"" that looks conspicuously different than the others, but since her hair was pulled back and she had glasses on and a goofy grin, I probably just thought it was a \'bad\' picture and moved on.\n\nThere were signs, but obviously my best friend - this girl that I spent tons of time with, spent hours on the phone with, eventually fooled around with - wouldn\'t just lie to my face about something like this.

We\'d already fallen apart after she met a new guy and then I moved halfway across the country, but even after that, my partner made it clear years ago that she wasn\'t comfortable with it because of our past and the feelings I\'d had for her, so I fully ended things.

But I also came to understand that everyone makes wrong the choice sometimes and deserves some grace and a safe space to understand where they went wrong. That the way my mom reacted and talked me because of how I navigated the situation is not how anyone should be treated. My cousin really helped me understand this, she was so disgusted by my mom\'s words and kept telling me, ""I don\'t think my mom could even imagine talking to me like that"". I stayed with her for the rest of my visit because I was so afraid of my mom and how she was going to act when I saw her in-person again. I was having panic attack after panic attack just thinking about going back to my mom\'s apartment to get my stuff. During these couple days my mom was texting me over and over, saying awful things and reminding me over and over that I was a horrible person and that I should be ashamed of myself, that she was justified in being so angry, and ""how dare I ignore her"". My cousin did try and talk to her calmly over the phone about what happened (She refused to let me talk to her, I will always be thankful for the way she stood up for me), to let her know that it wouldn\'t happen again and that we were all remorseful, but she wouldn\'t listen and kept calling me a coward for ""making you do his dirty work"", and that my cousin was ""gaslighting her with her psychology bullshit"" (My cousin is getting her degree in Psychology to be a Speech Pathologist and currently works as a BCBA).\n\nAfter a couple days (Or maybe it was one day, I\'m not completely sure. Time slowed down for me), my cousin and her boyfriend took me to my mom\'s apartment to get my stuff and she was silent the whole time I was gathering my things into my suitcase. Right before we left, she wanted to talk to me alone but I refused because I didn\'t want to face another one of her screaming fits by myself. She basically told us three that we were horrible, and that we only ever thought of ourselves. Then she started screaming about how none of us had been there for her during her divorce with my dad (We were, constantly. We all had been taking extra care to make sure we were always helping out when visiting and made sure she always had someone to talk to, and went all out on Mother\'s day). I, again, don\'t remember most of the screaming, but I do remember feeling disgusted and being comforted afterwards by my cousin and her boyfriend. I remember them being so kind to me and helping me talk through it, allowing me to open up about my experiences growing up with her. They both really opened my eyes to the fact that what I experienced growing up was abuse, telling me about their own upbringings and how they couldn\'t even imagine their parents acting like that. After that I decided I couldn\'t do it anymore, I couldn\'t let her continue to treat me like a punching bag and allow her to send me into states of constant panic attacks and thinking horribly of myself because of the things she says when she\'s too angry to think. I went no-contact for a couple of months, and I am now very low-contact (it is the Holidays after-all). My cousin and her boyfriend went low-contact afterwards, and she reached out to apologize to them and that she ""didn\'t remember what I said, all I saw was red and started screaming"". My cousin urged her to apologize to me as well, but she refused and said she apologized in her own way and that I should know it (She didn\'t, and I did not).\n\nSince going no-contact my anxiety has pretty much gone away, and my self-esteem is a lot higher. I\'ve lost weight, I\'ve been talking to my friends more, and I even came back out of the closet because of how safe and comfortable I feel now. I don\'t know where I will go from here. On one hand my quality of life has improved drastically in a short amount of time from going no-contact, but on the other hand it\'s deeply distressing to imagine my life without my mom in it. I want her to change, and I want her to treat me better and with kindness because she\'s my mom and I love her, but I don\'t think I have the will to allow someone like that to be a part of my life anymore.\n\nAlso, I feel it\'s important to add that my grandma was okay!

In many ways, weed gave me the clarity I needed to figure out my real passions and commit to them.\n\n**The Bad** \nAt the same time, getting high felt so incredible that almost everything else started to lose its appeal. When I was high, life was fascinating—I felt like I could delve deeper into any topic, figure out solutions to every problem, and just see the world in a richer, more vibrant way. But once the high wore off, I felt empty and dull, like a blank shell of myself. I started believing that the only time the world had any color was when I was high.

Some people need it and some people can use without it affecting them as it affects me. Everyone is different and I respect that.

Here’s why this advice is important and how it can help prolong a marriage:\n\n1. Reduces Conflict and Defensiveness\n\t•\tPhrases like “You always do this” or “You never listen to me” are often exaggerated and inaccurate. They can make your partner feel unfairly criticized or attacked, leading to defensiveness and conflict.\n\t•\tInstead, focusing on specific instances encourages a more constructive discussion. For example, say, “I felt unheard during our conversation earlier,” instead of “You never listen to me.”\n\n2. Encourages Fairness\n\t•\tAbsolute statements dismiss the positive actions or efforts your partner has made, no matter how small. This can make your partner feel unappreciated.\n\t•\tAcknowledging their efforts, even if there are areas for improvement, helps balance the conversation and fosters mutual respect.\n\n3. Allows for Growth and Flexibility\n\t•\tAbsolutes suggest a fixed mindset, implying your partner is incapable of change. This can discourage efforts to grow or improve in the relationship.\n\t•\tUsing language that reflects hope and openness—like “I’d appreciate if we could work on this together”—creates a sense of teamwork and possibility.\n\n4. Fosters Emotional Safety\n\t•\tWhen one partner uses absolutes, the other may feel judged or misunderstood, which erodes emotional safety and trust over time.\n\t•\tAvoiding extreme language shows you value your partner’s feelings and are open to dialogue rather than blame.\n\n5. Promotes Better Problem-Solving\n\t•\tAbsolutes escalate emotions and derail problem-solving because they focus on blame rather than the issue at hand.\n\t•\tReplacing “always” and “never” with “often,” “sometimes,” or “in this instance” keeps the conversation solution-oriented.\n\nExample Shift in Communication:\n\t•\tInstead of: “You never help with the chores!”\n\t•\tTry: “I feel overwhelmed managing the chores. Can we create a plan to share them more evenly?”\n\nBy avoiding absolutes, you promote understanding, reduce conflict, and create a space where both partners feel valued and heard—key ingredients for a lasting marriage.', 'We communicate honestly.\n\n\nAlso, she is a fundamentally good person who chooses not to poison me, even when I deserve it.', ""Talking about shit.

There is a reason you decided to get married. Keep deciding. Keep finding things to like and admire about each other. Liking is as important as loving.  \nBe dependendable but not codependent. Support and let yourself be supported. Trust and be trustworthy. Respect each other's interests, pursuits, and opinions without feeling obliged to adopt each others. Have mutual friends and your own friends.  \nExpect each other to change. Give each other that space. Applaud and support growth even when it's not in the same direction. Find areas where you can grow together.  \nSpeak up. Neither of you are mind readers. If you need something, tell the other person. If you don't like something, address the issue. Don't make assumptions about the other person's thoughts, plans, or motives. Listen. Listen.  \nForgive.  Don't hold grudges or bitterness. Try not to bring past baggage into present disagreements. That said, it's okay to change the way you do things in a realtionship based on patterns of behavior. That's not the same as not forgiving.  \nBoundaries. Explain your boundaries, especially new ones. Respect the other person's boundaries even if yours look different.  \nCounseling. Sometimes you need a neutral party to help you sort out differences or help you get unstuck."", ""26 years here.  \n\nHere are a couple things that have worked for us: \n\n1) Through even the most difficult times, we've always been each other's best friends.\n\n2) For me, I learned that the discomfort of having a difficult conversation far outweighs holding in resentments that erode the relationship.  \n\n3) Realize that relationships naturally ebb and flow and that's okay.  Not every day, week, month or year are going to be fireworks, but others will.  You need to put in the effort to get the fireworks, but don't panic if you are in a lull. \n\n4) Have the humility to look inward when there is a problem. There have been times where I was unhappy with my wife and under deeper reflection, I realized that I owned a lot of it.  \n\n5) If you have kids, you have to take time away to focus on yourselves. Your kids will grow up and move out but you will remain and that relationship needs care and feeding and maintenance.\n\n6) Understand that you and your partner will continuously evolve and change.  Big life events like losing one's parents can permanently change someone.  New jobs or hobbies will evolve us. The person I married 26 years ago is not the same person I'm married to today, and I am absolutely not the person my wife married 26 years ago.  Flexibility and adaptability are critically important.\n\n7) Meet the moment.  There will be times in your partner's lives that they really need you and how you meet the moment will greatly impact and define the relationship.  For example, my mother-in-law no longer could live on her own so we had her move into our house and she was with us for maybe a year before she passed away.  Was this inconvenient?  Yes – 100%. But it was also the right thing to do and it provided the most level of dignity and grace for her mother-in-law.  During that time, my wife was a big ball of stress and I realized that in this season of our relationship, I needed to give more than I could receive. Similarly, I had a serious injury riding a mountain bike and my wife was there for me at every moment going out of her way to be kind to me and do special things.  These moments largely define your relationship so when they happen, do the thing that will make your partner love you even more deeply.\n\n8) Buy the book Crucial Conversations and read it.  And after you are finished, re-read it.  It will make greatly increase the quality of conversations when there is a disagreement.\n\nFinally, I obviously don't know anything about you and your situation, but it's really awesome that you're asking this question in the first place!

I wouldn't say isolated, more that your friend group and activities change rather than you become isolated.

He woke up crying at 1:40am because he doesn’t feel well, and it took me almost 2 hours to get him to sleep in his crib. With the teething and sickness, he’s been super fussy for days, clingy AF, and I’m totally burnt out and exhausted because I’m dealing with it alone while my husband is on a work trip. \n\nWith that being said, I’m telling you: it really IS all worth it. Of course it’s hard. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life by far. But just because something is hard doesn’t mean it’s not also incredibly enjoyable and rewarding. Almost all of the aspects of my life that I enjoy today came about because I worked really hard at growing them into what they are—my career, my marriage, and now my child.  \n\nAlmost every night after my husband and I finally get my son to sleep, we inevitably end up scrolling through pictures of him or recounting stories of funny or cute things he did that day.

He’s my little buddy. \n\nWhen he wakes up in the morning he sits up in his crib and waits for me to come get him while babbling to himself. When he sees me, he breaks out into a huge shit eating grin and we hug each other tightly while I carry him out of the room. I could die in those moments and be happy. \n\nParenting is incredibly difficult but the good parts are REALLY good and make every hard moment melt away. \n\nWatching a little tiny human learn the world and grow into themselves is an unrivaled experience.

These days trees are old news. \n\nNow he’s becoming his own little person with his own personality and preferences. He plays a little game every night now where he pretends he’s asleep on dad’s chest after his bottle and then pops back up and laughs his ass off at his own trick.

And there are tons of people who have kids, which means there are tons of adults you met via kids sports/school/etc. when you look for things to do with your kids you end up getting out into the community more and you make more friends. And you bond with other parents. It’s not isolating by default.\n\nBut think of it this way- \xa0Were you less of a person when you were a child?\xa0\n\n\xa0Kids are people.

It didn’t work out because of our religious differences but as a person she was the best. I found it very attractive how attentive she was to everything. She was very feminine, she really liked the traditional view of what a man and woman were supposed to be in a relationship. At first I found it weird because I simply was never exposed to it and growing up I’ve always been taught the opposite, that such outlooks are outdated, sexist, etc. But she LIKED it. So I went along with it. This extended to everything, I basically decided what we ate, what we watched (she would recommend stuff but I had to be the person that decided), when we had sex and how often, she even wanted my opinion on how she dressed, what she can post on social media. At first it was all very odd to me, but as the relationship matured I got used to it and grew to love it.\n\nWe’ve only broken up for about 4-5 months now and I still love her.

Seeing her put on makeup had the opposite effect.\n\nShowing good habits, particularly healthy eating, also turns me on, but maybe not in a sexual sense. This probably stems from my own desire to eat healthy, and I can’t, because I eat whatever my family provides.\n\nAnd speaking intelligibly while also having a thick accent. Almost any accent would do, but especially Latina accents.\n\nAlso, passionately expressing beliefs that are rooted in logic.\n\nAnd gentle slaps to the arm or chest when they’re mildly upset. Something about their security about asserting their emotions physically without the intent to do harm, while expressing discontent, it just… does something to me. It shows that they have a level of comfort around you that I haven’t seen in the women I’ve dated, but that gesture might not been a part of the way they conduct themselves with anyone.\n\nWhen they give me a gift I actually appreciate even though I never asked for it. I’m not particularly materialistic, but when someone knows me well enough that they pick something that I’d like, it feels amazing. One time a girl bought me what I could only assume is some kind of trinket holder while simultaneously being a white tiger figurine, covered in rhinestones. It was kind of nice, and she probably picked it out because I like animals, but I don’t really have trinkets to put in it and I don’t really like sparkly things. My initial thought was “what in the world is this thing and why did she give me something so sparkly?” It made me feel like she didn’t know me as well as I thought, and made me question what she did think of me. I was probably thinking to deeply into it, but it was weird to think about, and not a positive contribution to our relationship, even though it wasn’t really a big deal. I would’ve preferred a nice little note or something else. One time she just gave me a little card where she wrote our nicknames for each other and glued a paper-craft type of heart thing to it, and I cherished that more than the sparkly tiger she spent money on.

Well both of us noticed this and she starts talking to me, we had quite a lot of free time before the exam started so we talked. She seemed REALLY familiar to be honest, and she thought the same about me. We hit it off and about an hour went by without even noticing anything. Even after the exam ended and we were allowed to go outside the exam hall, we purposely delayed it to talk to each other and it was pretty evident. I finally gathered the courage to ask for her instagram and she tells me that she isn’t on Instagram. Now I know this was a stupid move on my part, but I didn’t ask for her number as i thought it would be a bit much and I just said okay and we walked off in our separate directions. I come back home and regret it instantly. I send a text on the boys group chat that we NEED TO FIND THIS GIRL WHOEVER SHE WAS. they try for a week but were unable to do it without much information (I forgot her name because she had a really unique name and I have a really bad memory). Fast forward a year later and I get a follow request on Instagram and accept it. After a whole day passes, the girl who followed me that morning texts me around 11pm and asks if I remember her, and told me that we sat next to each other for an entrance exam. So I guess I wasn’t the only one searching for the other. She too, tried and kept trying :”). Bizarre feeling when I read her text and realised who she was. Genuinely heartwarming.']"

Why wouldn\'t it be a useful concept even if some people say ""I appreciate these three love languages but don\'t care about the other two""?\n\n> that there are five love languages\n\nPeople commonly think there are five senses – sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch – but there are actually several other ones, like proprioception. Obviously, the concept of senses doesn\'t hinge on there being exactly five of them – discovering proprioception doesn\'t mean that we suddenly turn blind or that it\'s meaningless to talk about having senses. \n\nSo it\'s really weird to me that these researchers seem to think that unless there are precisely five love languages, love languages don\'t exist.\n\n> and that when couples ‘speak’ the same love language it improves the quality of their relationships. \n\nThis is the first point that seems like relevant criticism.

I do not mean to ridicule, berate, degrade, or dishonor anyone; what is about to be posted is purely my thought which should not be seen as invalid or valid, but instead neither.\n\nMy point of the world, as an American first off starts within my country. Politics here are **very** divided. Now I am not saying that all far right and far left wingers are the same, but from what I see on the internet or the media (I don't talk about politics irl) we have two sides. One is a selfish and misinformed side; the other is full of people who are purely inconvenient even if they think or are morally right. Both sides are full of deranged idiots; not all of them fall under the idiot category, but I am talking about the type of far end idiots who are on Twitter and Bluesky.\n\nBoth sides support different causes. Right wing might be more mindful of business while the left may preach liberty and self-advocating. In terms of global conflicts, the right wants taxes to be used for the nation or other interests than the left (Israel for example) as they want terrorists that are a threat to the US to be annihilated with the knowledge that some innocent people are to be killed. The left may support the other side and be more generous, although a bit too much while the republicans rather keep money within our nation. Think about Ukraine or Palestine which are both targets of violence. The left again, would rather be morally good even if it is not so good for our own.\n\nThe right has radical clowns who will lie, lie, and lie. They will twist every fact that comes within their reach. They are masters of deception and will slowly twist the narrative to their favor. The left is careless often with the expense of few. Yes, they do advocate for personal freedoms most of the time, but often at the expense of the average kind of person.\n\nMany lack intelligence, those who think they are something (not want to be something) that they aren't, or those who spread stories that sound like they have been on the wildest drug trip ever. While it may seem innocent for children to play make believe or wrong for children to fib. In adults it is a very dangerous situation sometimes.\n\nWhy is this all terrible? My country is dangerous not only to those around us, but to ourselves who are and will continue to be divided. We often get involved in places we shouldn't often because of ideology. The existence of my country is hypocritical and is not run by we the people but rather the wealthy and influential.\n\nTechnology and social media is a huge infection. While it is great to have opinions, there is too much hate, discrimination, and calling out simply for the color of one's skin, or what gender they want to be or are. Meanwhile it has become a place for people to share their fetishes and spread misinformation which morally is wrong. Social media is meant to be a place to come together and talk casually with others of different cultures, origins, languages, genders, ages, opinions, thoughts, and so on. IT IS NOT FOR HATe AND MORAL VIOLATION! It has become full of nazis, perverts, assholes, and narcissists. \n\nI stand with no one.

Since the gender-related stuff has been placed on a pedestal any criticism effectively becomes a zero-sum game in which you are either fully in favor of it, or some massive hating monster with little to no in-between ground.\n\nSo if you have, say, a writer come into a series who doesn't actually \\*care\\* about said series and, instead, cares basically about pushing their own agenda, you get a situation where an apathetic, and likely bad, writer is effectively pushing a piece of terrible and likely contradictory writing as canon and forcing people to either accept it or be labeled as haters/monsters/etc. with no ground in-between. If you dislike the change for any reason, you're 'evil'. As a result, a bunch of people are shoved out, a good chunk of which likely have been fans of/involved in said franchise before said writer was even born/knew it existed/whatever in favor of a political/gender ideology message that is being pushed to the forefront and likely holds no realistic place in the franchise by a writer who doesn't care and possibly even \\*hates\\* said stuff.\n\nLike, imagine you went down to the local steakhouse. A good steak meal involves a steak, some sides and sauces, and maybe a salad, maybe not. But you're there for the steak. You don't \\*hate\\* salad, but it's not why you're there. Any good steak-house chef will know that and put their focus on the steak. But now imagine the steak house hired a vegan chef who comes in and suddenly the only 'steak' on the menu is vegan substitutes and maybe some fish which, at best, is being served resentfully and not even fully cooked. Instead they're focusing heavily on the salad and it's not even a \\*good\\* salad. It's storebought salad mix that's slightly wilted and even going a bit brown and you didn't even get the salad you ordered. But when you complain about it to the chef you get accused of hating all salads and wanting to be an animal-murdering carnivore. Do you think an experience like that is more or less likely to make you want to turn vegan or go to places that advertise being 'vegan-friendly'? You don't hate salads, you probably don't have an issue with vegans in-of themselves, but you probably are going to be pretty ticked and want to avoid eating at that steakhouse and anywheres else advertising their 'vegan-friendliness' again.\n\nThat's why, in my eyes, there's so much 'hate' towards these sorts of things. Because there are problems and issues that need addressing, but even acknowledging the existence of said problems and concerns seems to result in people getting hysterial and having it devolve into an 'all-or-nothing' type of situation. People get disgruntled and then take up a whole-sale rejection of the issue because their choices have effectively become unconditional acceptance or whole-sale rejection and the latter at least addresses the issue they had."", 'Is there that much gender hate in real life or is it just social media provocation?\n\nDo you see it in the streets, pubs, clubs or any social area or do you read about it on social media?\n\nI read about it a lot but don’t really see it in places I visit in the real world\n\nSo is it AI interference or is it a real thing?', 'yup', 'That so many people misuse terms does nothing to explain why there is so much gender-based hate.

I was a restaurant manager of a fine-dining restaurant located at the Ritz Carlton Boston Common during the filming of Mystic River. The cast and high-level production staff were staying at the hotel for 6 weeks or so, and we were 1 of 2 restaurants on property. Most of the cast would dine with us at least once a week, sometimes more. Except Sean Penn, he always ate at the other restaurant bc we were non-smoking, and they weren\'t.  \n\nOne super busy Saturday night, a group of 10 people came off the hotel elevator at 730 and asked if they could get a table. We were booking out 6 weeks for a Saturday reservation at 730 at that time, but being that they were hotel guests, we cobbled together some tables and chairs borrowed from the Cafe, and squeezed them in at the far end of the bar. The service staff were all super busy with their sections,  so I served the table. At the end of their meal, they mentioned that they were senior-level production staff for the film, appreciated the accommodation, and promised to return frequently and spread the word about us. \n\nThe next night, two of the older guys from the night before came in with Clint Eastwood and sat at the bar. They called me over and introduced me to Mr. Eastwood told him about the night before, and explained that they were his long-time friends,  are with him on all his movies, and that we would be seeing them a lot.\n\n\nI remember the conversation vividly. They were super gregarious and comfortable, and introduced me to him like I was one of their old pals. ""Hey xxxxxx! Come on over here! You gotta meet Clint. Hey, Clint, this is the guy that runs the joint, took good care of us last night, his name is xxxxx."" Then f\'n Clint Eastwood turns to face me, shakes my hand, and says ""Yeah. Hi xxxxx. Good to meet you, son."" All slow, and cowboy-like. I can\'t believe I was able to respond coherently, but I did. I also didn\'t embarrass myself, despite being star-struck. Something that had never happened despite all the fancy VIPs and famous people that dined with sand I had interacted with. \n\nA few days later, Mr. Eastwood came in for dinner and asked for a table in the dining room, at the furthest back corner. Given his level of fame, other diners tried every trick in the book to talk to him, which he really wasn\'t into. He just wanted to have dinner and not sign a ton of autographs, take pictures with stranger,  etc, so I became a de facto bouncer at his table, keeping folks away, and trying to do my job at the same time. Things were like this the next few times he came in. \n\nOne night, he came in with his then-wife, Dina. They had dinner together,  he called me over to introduce me to her, and because we had developed a repoire with each other, we chatted for a while. They came in a couple more times together, and then one night he popped in and explained that the film schedule was shifting to nights, and since his wife was still in town, he preferred she didn\'t have to eat alone. He asked me if I would join his wife for dinner that night and the following night, when his MIL and his daughter would be in town. This was NUTS! But why not, right? \n\nWe got along swimmingly, his family were kind and interesting, and I really enjoyed both evenings.\n\nThey dined with us a few more times,  and then one morning, I walk in to work around 1030 am, and the hostess handed me a hand written note that said: ""Sorry we missed you!

If someone builds something amazing, why shouldn’t they enjoy the fruits of their labor? But the problem is that we keep hearing stories about how billionaires exploit loopholes, dodge taxes, and make their money by screwing over their workers. That’s where it gets really hard to justify.\n\nTake Luigi Mangione, for example. His alleged actions—murdering a CEO—are horrifying and absolutely indefensible, but they reflect a level of frustration in society that’s hard to ignore. When people feel like the system is rigged, like the rich get richer while the working class struggles, it creates the conditions for resentment to boil over.\n\nWhat scares me most is the possibility of a class war. Mangione’s case could just be a glimpse of what happens when the wealth gap keeps widening and people feel powerless. The repercussions of that kind of anger spilling over are terrifying—society can’t function when people are at each other’s throats.\n\nSure, billionaires can exist, but they have to step up. They need to use their wealth responsibly, treat their workers fairly, and contribute to the world instead of just hoarding power and resources. Otherwise, we’re heading down a really dangerous road.', 'In a world where there are such financial disparities it is unethical in my opinion. No one need billions, I think that if all people gave away their earnings past a set amount (something like 500 millions for example) to systems that benefit society as a whole then everyone would be better off.\n\nThe only problem is that I can’t think of a single government in this world that would handle that money correctly without corruption and/or waste, so would such a thing really matter?', ""Tough question, I would say no because they don't have an obligation to provide for others just because they are well off"", 'What most people do not realize is that these people are accumulating power, and the wealth is secondary.\n\nControl of public corporations is decided by the stockholders, and when you have the most stock you have the most say.  That stock is also worth money.
